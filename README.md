# GeniTree
### Your genetic family tree

GeniTree is a project I built with Lavanya Arora and Darcy Yang at the Lumina.House x ThradAI x Vercel hackathon of 15Feb 2026.

The problem we solve is the lack of centralisation in hereditary health data. Most medical symptoms and risk of certain diseases (for ourselves/children) are linked to hereditary factors. With GeniTree, we proposed a digitised family health history, with the integration of the Google API to "speak to your data" with gemini. 

Examples GeniTree can help with:
1. prevention: planning certain medical tests early if there is a specific disease risk in your family
2. understanding if symptoms could be chronic or due to genetic factors as opposed to temporary
3. learning about potential risks that children could be exposed to (genetic compatibility)
4. etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
